Salut/Namastey,
I'm Kaushik.
I'm a software engineer with a penchant for automation. I love working with Open Source technologies.
I love designing solutions to complex scenarios by utilizing the capabilities that these technologies offer.
My major contribution has been in the field of 'Quality Assurance'.
My expertise ranges from understanding end-to-end application, to designing and executing tests and presenting a holistic report to my clients. 
Apart form all functional capabilities that are expected from Quality folks, I bring with me a pool of knowledge on 'Test Automation' front.
